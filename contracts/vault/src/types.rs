//!
//! # Gas Optimization Notes
//!
//! This module implements several gas optimization techniques:
//!
//! 1. **Type Size Optimization**: Using smaller integer types (u32 instead of u64) where
//!    values won't exceed the smaller type's range. This reduces storage and serialization costs.
//!
//! 2. **Storage Packing**: Related fields are grouped in `Packed*` structs to minimize
//!    the number of storage operations. A single storage read/write is cheaper than multiple.
//!
//! 3. **Lazy Loading**: Large optional fields (attachments, conditions) are stored separately
//!    to avoid paying for their serialization when not needed.
//!
//! 4. **Bit Packing**: Boolean flags are combined into a single u8 bitfield where possible.
